# DIYIntervalometer // WORK IN PROGRESS//
My DIY Intervalometer using an arduino nano and relay.
In this repository you will find the arduino code,for a diy intervalometer,using a 2.5 mm jack cable. I created this for my Canon EOS 1200D,you have to check if your camera works
the same,or not.
<h1>Parts:</h1>     
<ul>
<li>Arduino Nano</li>
<li> 0.96" OLED IIC LCD display</li>
<li>6 push buttons </li>
<li>cheap cable release for the cable(you can use a simple 2.5mm jack cable too) </li>
<li>5V 1 channel relay</li>
<li>cables</li>  
</ul>

I decided to make this mainly for astrophotography,but you can use it for normal timelapses too.  
The intervalometer right now has 3 modes.  
<h1>Mode 1  </h1>
You put the shutterspeed in first,than you enter how many pictures you want to take. This mode requires your camera to be in bulb mode.
<h1>Mode 2  </h1>
In this mode you just put in how many pictures you want to take.
<h1>Mode 3  </h1>
This is like a normal time lapse mode. You first enter the duration, then the interval between pictures.
